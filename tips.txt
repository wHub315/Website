# Make sure to fully comprehend your task before you start coding.
# Plan out your functions before you try implementing them
# Break down big problems into smaller functions as much as possible for easier testing
# Test every step of the way.
# Use a variety of files with different inputs to test, not just the same one.
# If you discover an error in your code, ensure it isn’t repeated elsewhere (it likely is).
# Just because your code works, doesn’t mean it’s right.
# The best solution is usually the one that takes the least amount of space.
# Ensure you are using the resources given to you to their fullest extent
