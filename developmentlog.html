Introduction</span></h2><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c1">I am writing this blog to document my experience learning html and working on project 1 for CSCE 315. The goal of this project was to create a functional website with several aspects. The first being proc_csv. Read in data from a CSV file and output it into a nicely formatted table. Then comes proc_wikitext. Convert a file using the wikitext article into a nice looking webpage. The next part of my site was gallery.php. This aspect of the project was to read in images from a file and display them in a nicely formatted way. The final part of the project was creating the search function. Here, you would enter a keyword into an html form on my website and the function would return links to every page on my website where the keyword was used. If you click the link it will display the contents of the webpage with the keyword highlighted. My website also includes a small information section on the main page, a tips page, and a list of resources that helped me along this arduous journey.</span></p><h2 class="c0" id="h.aiexsjm2alvc"><span>2. New skills I learned</span></h2><p class="c2 c6"><span>I learned how to use regular expressions. Used to search for matching patterns; r</span><span class="c1">egular expressions are similar to strings. There are several extremely useful regular expression functions I learned to use throughout my project: Preg_match_all was likely the most important. It allows one to search a given string for a regular expression. Returns false if the regular expression is not found. You may pass it a flag PREG_OFFSET_MATCH where it will store the index of all matches in the array $matches. </span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span>The next one is preg_replace. Replaces instances of a regular expression in a string with another given string. Something else </span><span>I learned was how to create a CSS for my website. </span><span>CSS allows one to define how their output is formatted when people view their page. CSS gives one many options to customize one&rsquo;s page. You accomplish this </span><span class="c7">outside</span><span>&nbsp;of the php scope. Calling the &lt;style&gt; tag before the php code allows one to create one&rsquo;s own tags or modify built-in ones to change the way the elements are displayed. The website w3schools was really helpful for me in developing my understanding of CSS.</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span>T</span><span>he html language has many useful built-in tags for output formatting. You can also create your own tags. I was working on my proc_wikitext function and I wanted my output text to be a certain size. There aren&rsquo;t any built in tags that can do this for me. This is where creating one&rsquo;s own tag will come in handy! You can create a tag in the CSS similarly to how one defines a function. Simply give the name of the tag you want to create and enclose the body in curly brackets underneath. </span></p><h2 class="c0" id="h.9j8mw0hiac0q"><span>3. &nbsp;Major challenges</span></h2><p class="c2 c6"><span>The biggest </span><span class="c1">challenge of proc_csv was handling data with quotations. A string in the data file surrounded by quotations can contain a delimiter without being split into another cell. My solution was to search each line of data for quotations. If it contained quotations I replaced all delimiters within the indexes of the quotations with an arbitrary character. I could then call preg_split. Then, while outputting the data into the table, I could simply call preg_replace and replace the arbitrary character with the delimiter again. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another major challenge I encountered working on this project was formatting my output for my gallery function. The most difficult part was ensuring the images in the list and matrix outputs took up a certain percentage of the screen. I managed to solve these issues with the use of CSS. I created separate tags for my list images and my matrix images. Inside of these tags I could set the width as a percentage of the browser window. The next issue was to get the descriptions for the matrix view to match up underneath each image. I created a tag for the descriptions and forced them to display as an inline block. This means that they will be printed in line and not on their own line. It also allowed me to define a width, which I set as the same width as the matrix image tag. This allowed the descriptions to be directly underneath the images with each taking up a third of the browser width. </span></p><p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final challenge I encountered on this project was highlighting the text in the search function. It took a </span><span class="c7">lot</span><span>&nbsp;of trial and error to come up with a solution. I eventually settled on reading in the html content of the webpage into a string object. I then defined a regular expression that would only match with text </span><span class="c7">not</span><span>&nbsp;inside of an html tag. I could then call preg_replace to replace the matching keyword with the highlighted keyword without breaking the formatting of the html document.</span></p><h2 class="c11" id="h.i5ukc5lzuyxl"><span>4. &nbsp;Assessment </span></h2><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c1">I learned that it&rsquo;s best to keep your code broken up into as many functions as possible. This is because it is much easier and less time consuming to test one small block of code as it is implemented, than to type out a huge wall of code and try to debug from there. I also learned that regular expressions were extremely powerful and could perform any number of tasks as long as one knew the syntax. I also learned the hard way that procrastination on a project as big as this one is simply not feasible. It is best to chip away at a major task little bits at a time than to try to tackle it all at once. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were many aspects of the project that I enjoyed. Learning how to use php was honestly really fun, and I&rsquo;m sure it will come in handy for any personal projects I may work on down the line. The CSS styling was another fun aspect. Learning how to manipulate the output in an easy to understand manner was very satisfying, and it was nice to see my website looking better with each modification. Regular expressions are also a great tool I had never used before working on this project, and are something that are sure to be in my repertoire next time I work on a major project like this one.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proc_wikitext function was extremely time consuming as I took the time to account for any input. The search function was also quite frustrating to work on. Coming up with the regex for the solution took hours of trial and error until it was working to a point where I was satisfied. The website regexone was pivotal in increasing my understanding of regular expressions.</span></p><h2 class="c11" id="h.wvxnhjxn5132"><span class="c15">5. Conclusion</span></h2><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c3">From the lessons I learned, to the challenges I encountered on this project, to the solutions I came up with; this project taught me a lot about php and how to code with it. Learning how to properly utilize regular expressions majorly decreased my workload. If I could do anything different it would be to dedicate more time to each day working on the project instead of attempting to solve a large portion of my project in just a couple of days. I would also take more time to style my website better instead of leaving it until the last minute. The last thing I would do is use the regexone website referenced below to practice my regular expressions earlier.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c9 c18">References</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">Learn Regular Expressions - Lesson 1: An Introduction, and the ABCs.
